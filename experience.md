## Experience

### Research Associate<br>Department of Engineering, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK<br>September 2025 – Present

- Investigating probabilistic machine learning techniques as part of the [Prob_AI Hub](Prob_AI Hub).

### Assegnista di Ricerca (Postdoctoral Researcher)<br>Istituto di Matematica Applicata e Tecnologie Informatiche "E. Magenes", Pavia, Italy<br>February 2024 – September 2025

- Developed novel multi-fidelity surrogate modelling algorithms for use with "noisy" solution data, including applications to complex, coupled modelling problems.
- Focused on data-driven approximation via sparse grid polynomial interpolation methods and exploiting spectral polynomial approximation properties.
We used adaptive experimental design optimally select sampling points to fit a multi-fidelity surrogate model.
Our novel algorithm offers robust computationally efficient surrogate modelling for parametric problems. We focused on applications in uncertainty quantification and optimisation.
- Implemented and analysed complex test problems including a NASA turbulent fluid flow validation case via `OpenFOAM` and `ParaView`, and use of `SLURM` high performance computing facilities.
- Numerical experiments required containerisation and deployment of `Python`, `Julia`, and more complex solvers via `Docker` and `Kubernetes`.
This included contributions to benchmark models for the *Democratising Uncertainty Quantification* project.
- Contributed to the development of the widely used [Sparse Grids MATLAB Kit](https://sites.google.com/view/sparse-grids-kit) and developed a novel `Julia` surrogate modelling package [`SparseGridsKit.jl`](https://benmkent.github.io/SparseGridsKit.jl/dev/).
- Co-organised mini-symposia focusing on surrogate modelling at Adaptive Modeling and Simulation (ADMOS) 2025 and the Biennial Numerical Analysis Conference 2025.
- Presented a seminar at Sandia National Laboratories, USA, and an *invited talk* for the UM-Bridge Workshop 2024 in addition to a number of conference talks.
- Supervised by Lorenzo Tamellini, with collaborators at Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya, Spain.
- [IMATI](https://www.imati.cnr.it/) is a *Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche* (CNR) institute.

### PhD in Numerical Analysis<br>The University of Manchester, UK<br>September 2019 – November 2023

- Industry sponsored ICASE project with *IBM Research UK*, supervised by Professor Catherine Powell and Professor David Silvester.
- Investigated computationally efficient adaptive-in-time approximation for parametric, time-dependent partial differential equations.
- Specifically, developed a novel *adaptive-in-time sparse-grid stochastic collocation* algorithm for approximation of parametric time-dependent advection–diffusion problems.
Numerical experiments demonstrated the computational efficiency even for high dimensional parametric inputs that would be intractable for naive tensor-based approximations.
- Studied topics in *Functional Analysis*, *Approximation Theory and Finite Element Analysis*, *Adaptive Finite Element Methods*, *Uncertainty Quantification* (*Monte Carlo methods*, *stochastic collocation*, *stochastic Galerkin methods*) and *Bayesian inverse problems*.
- Co-organiser of Manchester Mathematics Research Student Conference in 2020 and Mathematics of Data Science student conference in 2020.
- Communication of my research included an *invited seminar for IBM Research UK* in 2022 and *"Best Student Talk"* prize at the Manchester SIAM-IMA Student Chapter Conference 2023.
- Thesis: *Efficient Approximation of Parametric Parabolic Partial Differential Equations*.
- Teaching assistant for Matrix Analysis MATH36001, Mathematical Workshop MATH10001, and Complex Analysis MATH20142.
