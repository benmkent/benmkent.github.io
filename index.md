Attained PhD in *Numerical Analysis* in the [Department of Mathematics](https://www.maths.manchester.ac.uk/) at The University of Manchester.
My research was into the *numerical analysis* and *a posteriori error estimation* of adaptive approximations to *parametric partial differential equations*.
I was supervisored by [Professor Catherine Powell](https://personalpages.manchester.ac.uk/staff/Catherine.Powell/) and [Professor David Silvester](https://personalpages.manchester.ac.uk/staff/david.silvester/). My PhD was an iCASE sponsored project with [IBM Research UK](https://research.ibm.com/labs/uk).

Prior to my PhD, I attended The University of Warwick. I recieved a First-Class Honours BSc in [Mathematics and Physics BSc](https://warwick.ac.uk/study/undergraduate/courses/mathsphysicsbsc/).

I also worked for four years at the multi-national engineering company [Thales UK](https://www.thalesgroup.com/en/countries/europe/united-kingdom).
