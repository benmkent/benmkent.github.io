I am a final year PhD student in the [Department of Mathematics](https://www.maths.manchester.ac.uk/) at The University of Manchester.
My research is into the *numerical analysis* and *a posteriori error estimation* of adaptive approximations to *parametric partial differential equations*.

My supervisors are [Professor Catherine Powell](https://personalpages.manchester.ac.uk/staff/Catherine.Powell/) and [Professor David Silvester](https://personalpages.manchester.ac.uk/staff/david.silvester/).
