I currently hold a postdoc position at [Istituto di Matematica Applicata e Tecnologie Informatiche "E. Magenes" (IMATI)](https://www.imati.cnr.it/make_home_page.php?language=ITA) working with [Lorenzo Tamellini](https://sites.google.com/view/lorenzo-tamellini/home-page).

I attained PhD in *Numerical Analysis* from the [Department of Mathematics](https://www.maths.manchester.ac.uk/) at The University of Manchester supervisored by [Professor Catherine Powell](https://personalpages.manchester.ac.uk/staff/Catherine.Powell/) and [Professor David Silvester](https://personalpages.manchester.ac.uk/staff/david.silvester/). It was an iCASE sponsored project with [IBM Research UK](https://research.ibm.com/labs/uk).

I attained a First-Class Honours BSc in [Mathematics and Physics BSc](https://warwick.ac.uk/study/undergraduate/courses/mathsphysicsbsc/) at the University of Warwick.

I have four years experience in research focused roles at the multi-national engineering company [Thales UK](https://www.thalesgroup.com/en/countries/europe/united-kingdom).

# Research Interests
- Approximation and analysis of *parametric PDE* problems.
- *Sparse grid approximation* and related techniques.
- *A posteriori error estimation* and *adaptive* approximation of parametric PDEs.
- In particular, the above in the context of *parabolic* PDE problems.
- *Uncertainty quantification*.
