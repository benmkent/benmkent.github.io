I am excited to begin a postdoc position at [IMATI-CNR](https://www.imati.cnr.it/make_home_page.php?status=start) based in Pavia, Italy.

For the next 18 months, I will continue to investigate the approximation of parametric PDEs with a focus on sparse grid polynomial interpolation.
In particular, I will work on developing novel algorithms to implement within the [Sparse Grids MATLAB Kit](https://sites.google.com/view/sparse-grids-kit).
