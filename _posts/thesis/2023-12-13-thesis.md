After four years of hard work I have been awarded my PhD!

My thesis titled [Efficient Approximation of Parametric Parabolic Partial Differential Equations](https://research.manchester.ac.uk/en/studentTheses/efficient-approximation-of-parametric-parabolic-partial-different) is available online on through the University of Manchester website.
