# Education

**September 2019 – September 2023: PhD candidate at The University of
Manchester, UK**

-   Supervised by Catherine Powell and David Silvester.

-   Industry sponsored iCASE project with **IBM Research UK**. This has
    involved regular study groups with my industrial supervisor.

-   Submission of thesis in September 2023.

-   Thesis: *Efficient Approximation of Parametric Parabolic Partial
    Differential Equations*.

    -   I investigate an adaptive-in-time stochastic collocation
        approximation of a *parametric time-dependent
        advection–diffusion problem*.

    -   It is well known that approximation errors may grow through
        time. An adaptive-in-time approximation is constructed to
        control the approximation error whilst maintaining a low
        computational cost. High dimensional parametric spaces are
        considered.

    -   The approach considers an approximation using the *finite
        element method* in space, *adaptive timestepping*, and *sparse
        grid* polynomial interpolation in the parameter space.

    -   Parametric approximation error is estimated through a
        hierarchical technique and is balanced with a dynamic tolerance
        related to an estimate of the global timestepping error.

    -   A residual type strategy in space, time and parameter space is
        also considered.

**September 2012 – July 2015: Mathematics and Physics BSc, First-Class
Honours at The University of Warwick, UK**

-   **Prize** for the best exam results in my cohort.

# Industrial Experience

Prior to my PhD I worked for approximately four years at the
multi-national engineering company *Thales* before returning to
university. I started at *Thales Research and Technology* before
transferring to the research oriented *General Sonar Studies* group.  
**September 2017 – August 2019: Algorithm Developer at Thales,
Stockport, UK**

-   Processing and analysis of datasets to assess algorithm performance.

-   Required to work alongside systems and software teams to take
    customer requirements to algorithm specifications for implementation
    in products.

-   Design and testing of sensor array signal processing algorithms in
    MATLAB.

**September 2015 – September 2017: Research Engineer at Thales, Reading,
UK**

-   Graduate scheme with placements working on cryptography, radar
    signal processing, filtering and tracking algorithms.

-   A week at the University Defence Research Collaboration summer
    school 2016, University of Edinburgh.

**July 2014 – August 2014: Rules and Procedures Software Internship,
Lloyd’s Register, Southampton, UK**

-   Internship upgrading pieces of FEM software from FORTRAN to C++.
