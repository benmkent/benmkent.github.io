It includes algorithms for discretization by mixed finite element methods and a posteriori error estimation of the computed solutions. The package can also be used as a computational laboratory for experimenting with state-of-the-art preconditioned iterative solvers for the discrete linear equation systems that arise in incompressible flow modelling. A unique feature of the package is its comprehensive nature; for each problem addressed, it enables the study of both discretization and iterative solution algorithms as well as the interaction between the two and the resulting effect on overall efficiency.},

	abstract     = {The Incompressible Flow \& Iterative Solver Software (\ifiss) package contains software which can be run with MATLAB or Octave to create a computational laboratory for the interactive numerical study of incompressible flow problems. It includes algorithms for discretization by mixed finite element methods and a posteriori error estimation of the computed solutions, together with state-of-the-art preconditioned iterative solvers for the resulting discrete linear equation systems. In this paper we give a flavor of the code's main features and illustrate its applicability using several case studies. We aim to show that \ifiss can be a valuable tool in both teaching and research.}
