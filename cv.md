# Education

**September 2019 – September 2023: PhD candidate at The University of Manchester, UK**

-   Supervised by Catherine Powell and David Silvester.

-   Industry sponsored iCASE project with **IBM Research UK**.

-   Thesis: *Efficient Approximation of Parametric Parabolic Partial Differential Equations*.
    Submission: September 2023.

    -   I investigate an **adaptive-in-time stochastic collocation approximation** of a parametric time-dependent advection–diffusion problem.

    -   It is well known that approximation errors may grow through time. An adaptive-in-time approximation is constructed to
        control the approximation error whilst maintaining a low computational cost. High dimensional parametric spaces are considered.

    -   The approach considers an approximation using the finite element method in space, adaptive timestepping, and sparse grid polynomial interpolation in the parameter space.

    -   Parametric approximation error is estimated through a hierarchical technique and is balanced with a dynamic tolerance related to an estimate of the global timestepping error.

    -   A residual based strategy in space, time and parameter space is also considered using auxiliary local problems.

-   Completed courses in Approximation Theory and Finite Element Analysis, Adaptive Finite Element Methods, Functional Analysis and Uncertainty Quantification. Topics included a priori and a posteriori error estimation for FEM approximations of elliptic problems, UQ techniques including Monte Carlo, stochastic collocation and stochastic Galerkin methods.

-   Regular study group held with industrial supervisor. Topics studied include multi-level stochastic collocation and Monte Carlo methods, error estimation for ODE problems, error estimation for coupled elliptic-parabolic problems, reduced basis methods and neural networks.
-   Strong programming skills in MATLAB. Experience with C and C++.

**September 2012 – July 2015: Mathematics and Physics BSc, First-Class Honours at The University of Warwick, UK**

-   **Prize** for the best exam results in my cohort.
