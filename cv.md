# Experience

**Education**  
**September 2019 – November 2023: PhD in Numerical Analysis at The University of Manchester, UK**

-   Supervised by Professor Catherine Powell and Professor David Silvester.

-   Industry sponsored ICASE project with **IBM Research UK**.

-   Thesis: *Efficient Approximation of Parametric Parabolic Partial Differential Equations*.

    -   I investigate an **adaptive-in-time sparse-grid stochastic collocation approximation** of a parametric time-dependent advection–diffusion problem.

    -   I consider an approximation using the finite element method in space, adaptive timestepping with local error control, and sparse grid polynomial interpolation in the parameter space.

    -   Parametric approximation error is estimated through a hierarchical technique. An adaptive approximation is formed that controls the parametric error to a dynamic tolerance related to an estimate of the global timestepping error.

    -   A residual based error estimation strategy in space, time and parameter space is also considered.

-   Completed courses in *Uncertainty Quantification*, *Functional Analysis*, *Approximation Theory and Finite Element Analysis*, *Adaptive Finite Element Methods*.

-   Topics studied include UQ techniques (*Monte Carlo*, *stochastic collocation*, *stochastic Galerkin methods*), *a priori and a posteriori error estimation* for FEM approximations of elliptic problems and *Bayesian inverse problems*.

**September 2012 – July 2015: Mathematics and Physics BSc, First-Class
Honours at The University of Warwick, UK**

-   **Prize** for the best exam results in my cohort.

**July 2014 – August 2014: Rules and Procedures Software, Lloyd’s
Register, Southampton, UK**

-   Internship upgrading pieces of FEM software from FORTRAN to C++.

**September 2010 – July 2012: The College of Richard Collyer, Horsham,
UK**

-   A Levels: Mathematics A\*, Further Mathematics A\*, Physics A\*,
    Chemistry A\*, Electronics A\*.  
    GCSE: 10 A\* (inc Maths and English) + 1 A (French)
