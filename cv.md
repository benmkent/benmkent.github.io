# Experience

**September 2019 – November 2023: PhD in Numerical Analysis at The
University of Manchester, UK**  
I investigated the adaptive approximation of the solutions to
time-dependent partial differential equations with uncertain inputs.

-   Thesis: **Efficient Approximation of Parametric Parabolic Partial
    Differential Equations**.

-   Supervised by Professor Catherine Powell and Professor David
    Silvester. Industry sponsored iCASE project with **IBM Research
    UK**.

-   Researched and developed an **adaptive-in-time stochastic
    collocation approximation** for parametric time-dependent
    advection–diffusion problems. Parametric formulations are derived
    from an underlying description of problem uncertainty through the
    language of probability theory. Computationally efficient yet
    accurate approximations are essential for evaluating quantities of
    interest.

-   Finite element, adaptive timestepping and global polynomial
    approximation techniques are analysed. **Error estimation** through
    hierarchical and residual based techniques is investigated.
    Estimates are used to adaptively construct an approximation.

-   Studied courses in Uncertainty Quantification, Functional Analysis,
    Approximation Theory and Finite Element Analysis, Adaptive Finite
    Element Methods. Topics studied include Bayesian inverse problems,
    UQ techniques including Monte Carlo, stochastic collocation and
    stochastic Galerkin methods, and a priori and a posteriori error
    estimation for FEM approximations of elliptic problems.

-   Further reading group sessions studied multi-level stochastic
    collocation and Monte Carlo methods, error estimation for ODE
    problems, error estimation for coupled elliptic-parabolic problems,
    reduced basis methods and neural networks.

**September 2012 – July 2015: Mathematics and Physics BSc, First-Class
Honours at The University of Warwick, UK**

-   **Prize** for the best exam results in my cohort.

**July 2014 – August 2014: Rules and Procedures Software, Lloyd’s
Register, Southampton, UK**

-   Internship upgrading pieces of FEM software from FORTRAN to C++.

**September 2010 – July 2012: The College of Richard Collyer, Horsham,
UK**

-   A Levels: Mathematics A\*, Further Mathematics A\*, Physics A\*,
    Chemistry A\*, Electronics A\*.  
    GCSE: 10 A\* (inc Maths and English) + 1 A
